## Key Insights

- 💡 Overall Performance:
   - $12.1M in total sales across 34,821 distinct items sold through 397 store locations.
   - Retail sales ($2.2M) and warehouse transfers ($2.1M), with warehouse e-sales contributing $7.8M. 
- 💡 Product Performance:
   - Beer dominates in the data, with Corona Extra products leading sales significantly.
   - The top 10 items are heavily beer-focused, particularly Corona and Heineken brands. This suggests a strong dependency on beverage alcohol, specifically beer products.  
- 💡 Supplier Concentration:
   - Crown Imports is the dominant supplier by a substantial margin, followed by Miller Brewing Company and Anheuser Busch.
   - This creates potential supply chain risk through heavy reliance on a few key suppliers, particularly Crown Imports (which supplies Corona and Modelo brands).
- 💡 Seasonal Patterns:
   - Sales show clear seasonality with peaks in summer months (June-August), reaching approximately $1.5M monthly.
   - Notable dip in spring (April-May at ~$500K) and relatively stable performance in fall/winter around $1M.
   - This suggests strong seasonal demand, likely driven by summer beer consumption.
 - 💡 Sales Trends Over Time:
   - The time series shows declining sales trajectory from 2017 to 2020, with noticeable volatility.
   - Peak performance was in mid-2018, with a general downward trend afterward. This could indicate market challenges, increased competition, or other business pressures.
 - 💡Product Mix: 
   - While beer (particularly non-alcoholic and standard beer) represents the largest category, there's also presence of wine, liquor, kegs, and other item types, though at much smaller volumes.
   - This limited diversification means business performance is heavily tied to beer market dynamics.
